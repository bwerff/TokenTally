# SOC 2 Type I Compliance Plan

This document outlines the high-level controls and milestones required to obtain a SOC 2 Type I report. The plan assumes work begins in July 2025.

## Controls

The following control areas must be implemented and documented:

1. **Security policies** – establish information security, incident response and acceptable use policies. Publish them internally and require annual acknowledgement.
2. **Access management** – enforce single sign-on, multi-factor authentication and least privilege across all production systems.
3. **Change management** – document code review procedures and maintain audit trails for configuration changes.
4. **Vendor management** – track third-party services, review their SOC reports and maintain data processing agreements.
5. **Logging and monitoring** – centralise application logs, enable alerting for suspicious activity and review logs weekly.
6. **Backup and recovery** – run daily database backups and quarterly restore tests.
7. **Risk assessment** – perform and document an annual risk assessment covering all services and data flows.

## Timeline
